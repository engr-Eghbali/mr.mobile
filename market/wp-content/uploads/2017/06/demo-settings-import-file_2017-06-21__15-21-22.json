There\u2019s rather a lot of car here \u2013 the Dawn is 5.3 metres long, 1.9 metres wide, and it tips the scales at 2.5 tonnes. That makes it heavier than a seven-seat Audi\u00a0SQ7.\r\n\r\nYou notice how large the Dawn is merely by how long it takes to walk from one end to the other, while the wonderfully over-engineered, rear-hinged doors demand a lot of room as they swing open to nearly 90-degree angles from the\u00a0car.[\/tie_slide]\r\n\r\n[tie_slide]<a href=\"https:\/\/placehold.it\/960x540\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3490 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/placehold.it\/960x540\" alt=\"cmx16_pg_007_ext_full\" width=\"960\" height=\"540\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nLord no,\u00a0but nor is anything the Dawn does. And that\u2019s what so utterly beguiling about it. The engine is a 6.6-litre V12, mounted surprisingly far back under that front bonnet. It\u2019s shared with the Ghost saloon and Wraith coupe, but uses the former car\u2019s lower\u00a0output.\r\n\r\n\u2018Lower\u2019 still translates into 563bhp and 575lb ft of torque, mind, enough to propel the Dawn from 0-62mph in five seconds. The top speed is an electronically limited\u00a0155mph.[\/tie_slide]\r\n\r\n[tie_slide]<a href=\"https:\/\/placehold.it\/960x540\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3487\" src=\"https:\/\/placehold.it\/960x540\" alt=\"cmx16_pg_004_ext_full\" width=\"960\" height=\"540\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nYes and no. Push the accelerator all the way down \u2013 the pedal travel is \u201care you sure you want drive so uncouthly quickly?\u201d long \u2013 and with all 575lb ft available from just 1,500rpm, you\u2019ll be fired along exceedingly\u00a0rapidly.\r\n\r\nBut so desensitised is the Dawn that it\u2019s all bewilderingly drama-free. There\u2019s barely a muster of engine noise, no sense that turbochargers are boosting its output, and no tangible evidence of its automatic gearbox containing eight entire\u00a0speeds.[\/tie_slide]\r\n\r\n[\/tie_slideshow]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Electric doors. Are they\u00a0necessary?<\/h2>\r\nLord no,\u00a0but nor is anything the Dawn does. And that\u2019s what so utterly beguiling about it.

There\u2019s barely a muster of engine noise, no sense that turbochargers are boosting its output<\/blockquote>\r\nIn fact, every element of the Dawn smoothly irons out anything one might consider \u201cfeedback\u201d. The overly large steering wheel contains barely a jot of feel, while the biggest bumps you can find will all be smothered entirely by the suspension. My first few hours guiding the ginormous feeling Dawn around are pretty tentative,\u00a0then.\r\n\r\nYes and no. Push the accelerator all the way down \u2013 the pedal travel is \u201care you sure you want drive so uncouthly quickly?\u201d long \u2013 and with all 575lb ft available from just 1,500rpm, you\u2019ll be fired along exceedingly\u00a0rapidly.But get accustomed to the Dawn\u2019s size \u2013 its large wing mirrors mean you can point them down to show where the lane markings are, while still seeing everything behind you \u2013 and it\u2019s a fun car to build speed and confidence\u00a0in.\r\n<h2>Can you actually have fun in\u00a0it?<\/h2>\r\nSurprising amounts. At first, it feels like Rolls is doing everything it can to throw keen drivers off the scent: the steering is super slow, there\u2019s no option to manually control the gears, and there\u2019s barely any engine braking when you lift off the throttle, so you heave on the hard-working brakes more than you\u2019d\u00a0like.\r\n\r\n[tie_full_img]<a href=\"https:\/\/placehold.it\/960x540\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3492 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/placehold.it\/960x540\" alt=\"cmx16_pg_009_ext_full\" width=\"960\" height=\"540\" \/><\/a>[\/tie_full_img]\r\n\r\nYet once you realise there\u2019s plenty of grip hiding beneath all those cocooning layers of comfort, you can have a go at driving this thing quickly. The trick is not taking lots of speed into a bend \u2013 there\u2019s simply too much mass for that \u2013 but to carefully turn in and, once the car has obliged, use an indulgent amount of throttle so that the rear squats down and you ride that wave of luxurious speed out of the corner. Get the hang of it and you can carry some serious pace across country\u00a0roads.\r\n\r\nEqually, of course, you can settle down, using the smallest smidgen of its \u2018Power Reserve\u2019 gauge possible (rev counters are so unclassy) and enjoy what a masterfully refined car this is. Roof up, the silence is zen-like, and full-size adults will still be comfy in the\u00a0back.\r\n\r\nAbove 50mph and things can get a little cold and blustery if the soft top is folded, however. But let\u2019s blame Britain\u2019s wintry weather for that rather than the car. If it all gets a bit much, the roof can be operated at up to 30mph, though given the sheer size of it, the mechanism does take a little\u00a0while.\r\n<h2>Any other\u00a0demerits?<\/h2>\r\nIf we\u2019re nitpicking, yes. There\u2019s only one USB port, and it\u2019s located very unhelpfully if you wish keep your phone charged while using a sat nav app. And the Dawn isn\u2019t much fun to\u00a0park.\r\n\r\n[embed width=\"744\" height=\"418\"]https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PrqYohBV58o[\/embed]\r\n\r\nOtherwise, though, it\u2019s as supreme as you\u2019d hope. Perhaps more so. The materials are almost beyond description: only a few rogue buttons and the media screen layout highlight any BMW parts sharing, and everything from the copious swathes of wood to the thickly piled carpets (I\u2019ve never had anything as plush in my house) will make you feel so, so good. As does driving with the Spirit of Ecstasy in the middle of your view\u00a0forwards.\r\n\r\nRolls-Royce unashamedly goes its own way, even if that does make its cars ergonomically odd. The heating controls demand a degree of guesswork and the doors take some getting used to. But there\u2019s so much class and character here. It\u2019s an inspirational and irresistable car. The ultimate compliment? This one is specced to \u00a3331,500, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019d feel short-changed if I\u2019d actually paid\u00a0that.\r\n\r\nThat tells us it\u2019s an Audi Q5, BMW X3, Mercedes GLC and Porsche Macan rival. It looks nicely sharp and chiseled, in a way the car it replaces \u2013 did you know you can currently buy an Infiniti QX50? \u2013 isn\u2019t. The new one looks decent,\u00a0no?\r\n<blockquote class=\"alignleft quote-simple \">It will \u2018delegate\u2019 more onerous driving tasks to the car.<\/blockquote>\r\nIt\u2019s a concept for now, and that means little technical detail but much styling chatter. The design language is called \u2018Powerful Elegance\u2019, while the interior, when we see it, will be \u201cdriver-centric, passenger-minded\u201d. So expect some nods to sportiness in the dials, and the key dashboard controls to be angled towards the driver\u2019s seat, <em>a la<\/em>\u00a0BMW.\r\n\r\nPerhaps unexpectedly for a car that\u2019s \u201cdriver-centric\u201d, though, there is plentiful talk of autonomous-ness. \u201cInfiniti\u2019s autonomous drive technologies will act as a \u2018co-pilot\u2019 for the driver, empowering rather than replacing them,\u201d says the Japanese company."}
